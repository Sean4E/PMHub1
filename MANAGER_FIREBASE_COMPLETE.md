## 🔥 Real-Time Architecture

### Firebase Operations Pattern
```javascript
// 1. Prepare data
const data = { ... };

// 2. Try Firebase first
if (firebaseOps) {
    const success = await firebaseOps.updateTask/addTimeEntry/logActivity(...);
    if (success) {
        showToast('Synced across all apps!', 'success');
        return;
    }
}

// 3. Fallback to localStorage
hubState.section.push(data);
await saveHubState();
showToast('Saved locally - will sync when connection restored', 'warning');
```

### Real-Time Listeners
All apps have Firebase onSnapshot listeners that fire instantly when data changes:
- **Hub**: Preserves currentProject/currentArea selections during updates
- **Manager**: Updates managementProject and refreshes active view
- **Worker**: Updates available tasks and current task status

---

## 📊 Activity Tracking

### Unified Activity System
Manager now merges two activity sources:
1. **`activities`** - Legacy Hub activities
2. **`activityLog`** - Firebase operations (Worker/Manager)

```javascript
const allActivities = [
    ...hubState.activities,
    ...hubState.activityLog
];

const uniqueActivities = Array.from(
    new Map(allActivities.map(a => [`${a.id}_${a.timestamp}`, a])).values()
);
```

### Activity Types Tracked
- `CLOCK_IN` / `CLOCK_OUT` - Time tracking
- `TASK_START` / `TASK_COMPLETE` / `TASK_COMPLETE_DETAILED` - Task operations
- `AREA_CREATED` - Area management
- `TASK_CREATED` - Task management
- `REPORT` - Report submissions
- `EVENT_CREATED` - Calendar events
- `TOOL_CHECKOUT` / `TOOL_CHECKIN` - Tool tracking
- `USER_CREATED` - User management

---

## 🎨 UX Enhancements

### Toast Notifications
All operations provide clear feedback:
- ✅ Success: "Synced across all apps!"
- ⏳ In Progress: "Uploading..."
- ⚠️ Warning: "Saved locally - will sync when connection restored"
- ❌ Error: "Failed to sync: [error message]"

### Navigation Flow
- Clock-out returns to clock-in screen
- Task completion shows next available task
- Modal forms clear after successful submission
- Activity feed auto-refreshes on state updates

---
