3. [ ] Check console for Firebase onSnapshot message

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Worker sees new task within < 1 second
- ✅ Console shows: `☁️ Worker: Firebase update detected`
- ✅ Activity log shows: `TASK_ASSIGNED` entry

---

## Test 2: Clock-In Sync
**Objective**: Worker clocks in → Manager/Hub see it instantly

### Worker Actions:
1. [ ] Select project from dropdown
2. [ ] Click "Clock In"
3. [ ] Check console for Firebase write logs

## Console Commands for Testing

### Check Firebase Connection:
```javascript
console.log('Firebase enabled:', window.firebaseEnabled);
console.log('DB:', window.db);
console.log('Firestore:', window.firestore);
```

### Check Activity Log:
```javascript
// In any app
const state = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('pmSystemState'));
console.table(state.activityLog.slice(-10)); // Last 10 activities
```

### Check Specific Task:
```javascript
const state = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('pmSystemState'));
const project = state.projects[0];
const area = project.areas[0];
const task = area.tasks[0];
console.log('Task:', task);
```

### Force Firebase Refresh:
```javascript
if (firebaseOps) {
    firebaseOps.clearCache();
    console.log('Cache cleared - next operation will fetch fresh data');
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to fetch hub state"
**Solution**: Check Firebase connection, verify user is logged in

### Issue: "Task not found"
**Solution**: Check WBS matches, ensure parent references (projectId/areaId) are set

### Issue: Updates not syncing
**Solution**: Check browser console for Firebase onSnapshot logs, verify all apps have real-time sync enabled

### Issue: Duplicate activity logs
**Solution**: Check if old localStorage-based logging is still running alongside Firebase logging

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If all tests pass**:
   - ✅ Add same Firebase operations to Manager
   - ✅ Implement activity feed visualization in Hub
   - ✅ Build analytics dashboard

2. **If any tests fail**:
   - 🔍 Check console logs for detailed error messages
   - 🔍 Verify Firebase rules allow writes
   - 🔍 Check network tab for failed requests
