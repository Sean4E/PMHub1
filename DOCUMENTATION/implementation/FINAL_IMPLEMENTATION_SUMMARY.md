## 🔧 What Was Implemented

### 1. Hub - Area Creation Fixed ✅
**File**: [PM_Hub_CL_v01_024.html:5710-5813](PM_Hub_CL_v01_024.html#L5710-L5813)

**Changes**:
- Added Firebase direct write when creating areas
- Added comprehensive activity logging
- Added diagnostic console logging
- Converted area IDs to strings for consistency
- Added `createdBy` attribution

**Before**:
```javascript
async function addArea() {
    state.currentProject.areas.push(area);
    saveState(); // localStorage only
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
async function addArea() {
    state.currentProject.areas.push(area);

    // 🔥 REAL-TIME: Firebase write
    if (window.firebaseEnabled) {
        const docRef = window.firestore.doc(window.db, 'hubs', 'main');
        await window.firestore.setDoc(docRef, {
            ...hubState,
            lastModified: new Date().toISOString()
        });

        // Log activity
        hubState.activityLog.push({
            type: 'AREA_CREATED',
            message: `Hub created area: ${area.name}`,
            source: 'hub'
        });
    }
}
```

**Result**: Areas now sync instantly to Manager and Worker ✅

### 2. Manager - Photo Capture Added ✅
**File**: [manager.html:1219-1267](manager.html#L1219-L1267) (UI), [manager.html:2234-2445](manager.html#L2234-L2445) (Functions)

**Features Added**:
- Camera controls (open camera, switch camera, take photo, record video)
- Video preview with autoplay
- Media gallery with thumbnails
- Remove media functionality
- Photo/video capture with timestamp filenames
- Video recording with WebM format

**UI Components**:
- Camera control buttons
- Live camera preview
- Media gallery grid

- Media count display

**Functions Added**:
- `startCamera()` - Initializes camera with constraints
- `switchCamera()` - Toggle front/back camera
- `takePhoto()` - Capture photo from video stream
- `startRecording()` / `stopRecording()` - Video capture
- `closeCamera()` - Clean up camera resources
- `updateMediaGallery()` - Render captured media

### 3. Manager - Drive Upload Integration ✅
**File**: [manager.html:2593-2655](manager.html#L2593-L2655)

**Functions Added**:
- `uploadToGoogleDrive(blob, filename, folderId)` - Upload files to Drive
- `getTaskDriveFolder()` - Get target folder for uploads

**Enhanced Report Submission**:
```javascript
async function submitReport() {
    // Upload photos/videos to Drive
    for (let media of capturedMedia) {
        const uploadResult = await uploadToGoogleDrive(
            media.blob,
            media.filename,
            folderId
        );

        uploadedFiles.push({
            filename: media.filename,
            driveFileId: uploadResult.id,
            type: media.type
        });
    }

    const report = {
        ...
        mediaFiles: uploadedFiles,
        mediaCount: capturedMedia.length,
        uploadedCount: uploadedFiles.length
    };

    // Firebase write
    await firebaseOps.addPhotoReport(report);
}
```

**Result**: Manager can upload photos/videos to Drive with reports ✅

### 6. Firebase Operation Consistency ✅
**Verification**: All files checked

**Consistent Methods**:
- ✅ `firebaseOps.updateTask()` - Used in Hub, Manager, Worker
- ✅ `firebaseOps.addTimeEntry()` - Used in Manager, Worker
- ✅ `firebaseOps.addPhotoReport()` - Used in Manager, Worker
- ✅ `firebaseOps.logActivity()` - Used in Hub, Manager, Worker

**Activity Types**:
- ✅ `CLOCK_IN` / `CLOCK_OUT` - Time tracking
- ✅ `TASK_START` / `TASK_COMPLETE` / `TASK_COMPLETE_DETAILED` - Task operations
- ✅ `AREA_CREATED` / `TASK_CREATED` - Entity creation
- ✅ `REPORT` - Report submissions
- ✅ `EVENT_CREATED` - Calendar events
- ✅ `AREA_COMPLETE` - Area completion
- ✅ `NAVIGATION` - Worker navigation events (Worker-specific)
- ✅ `TASK_CONTINUE` - Task resume (Worker-specific)

**Data Structure Consistency**:
- ✅ All IDs are strings (`Date.now().toString()`)
- ✅ All timestamps are ISO strings
- ✅ All activities have `source` field (hub/manager/worker)
- ✅ All activities have `userId` and `userName`
- ✅ All operations log to `activityLog` array

**Result**: Complete naming consistency across ecosystem ✅
