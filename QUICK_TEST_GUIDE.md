## ❌ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "No project selected" error in Hub
**Fix**: Check console for `currentProject`. If null, selection preservation isn't working. Reload Hub.

**Fix**:
1. Check console for "Firebase initialized" in all apps
2. Verify network connection
3. Check Firebase console for data
4. Try refreshing all tabs

### Issue: Photos not uploading
**Fix**:
1. Check if Google Drive is authorized
2. Look for `accessToken` in console
3. Verify Drive folder structure exists
4. Check network for upload requests

### Issue: Duplicate activities in feed
**Fix**:
1. Check deduplication logic in `renderActivityFeed()`
2. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Reload all apps
